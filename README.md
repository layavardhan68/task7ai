# SVM Binary Classification (Simplified)

This is a basic machine learning project demonstrating how to apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification using the Breast Cancer Dataset from Scikit-learn. The code is kept simple for easy understanding and visualization.

---

## Features

* Uses only 2 features for easy 2D plotting
* Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel
* Visualizes decision boundary
* Prints classification report with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## Dataset

* Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset
* Included in sklearn.datasets

---

## Requirements

Install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
Packages needed:

* scikit-learn
* numpy
* matplotlib

---

## How to Run

Install the required libraries and run the Python script named `svm_simple.py`.

---

## Output

* Text Output: Classification Report
* Graph: Visualized SVM decision boundary (2D)
